sensu-flapjack-install
=============
This is a set of scripts for Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)to make the installation and configuration of Sensu and Flapjack more better.

After being a devote Nagios user for the better part of 15 years I can see the shortcomings of Nagios in the "Cloud" Age and the need for something more modern and able to handle dynamic infrastructure.


###Install
####Server
1. git clone https://github.com/ninja76/sensu-flapjack.git /tmp/sensu
2. cd /tmp/sensu/
3. sh install.sh

####Client
1. git clone https://github.com/ninja76/sensu-flapjack.git /tmp/sensu
2. cd /tmp/sensu/
sh install.client.sh

Done!
